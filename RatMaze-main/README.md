# RatMaze

A rat maze game using java Swing GUI, DFS algorithm, and multi-threading.

## Idea description

A Maze is given as 𝑁×𝑁 binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block 
i.e., maze [0][0]and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. 
A rat starts from source and must reach the destination.
The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down. 
In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination.
